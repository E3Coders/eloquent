=Values and Types

A role of a JS value can be determinded by its type. There are six
basic types:

* Numbers (represented with 64 bits)
* Strings
* Booleans
* Objects
* Functions
* Undefined

== Numbers

Numbers a reperesented with 64 bits.
You can use operators (+, -, *, /, %) on numbers.
There are three special numbers: Infinity, -Infinity and Nan (Not a
Number)

== Strings

The type Strings is used to represent text and use double or simple
quotes: "Ceci est une valeur de type String", 'Celle-ci aussi'.
You can use specials characters inside a String but you need to escape
them wiht a backslash (\):

* newline character with \n "First line\nSecond line"
* tab character with \t "A line follow by a \tTab line"

You don't need to add a space after the special character!
If you want to use the string "\n" but not the newline you need to
escape the characters:

* "I want \\n"
* "I want a quote \""
