#Programm Structure

##Expressions and Statements

For me:

* An expression is like a mathematical function. It take a value and return another value.
* A statement is a set of expressions with side effects (for exemple print
  something on the screen). Most of the time statement terminate with
  a ;

##Variables

We can define a variable with the keyword var.

the following statement define a variable myVar with the value 42:

* var myVar = 42;

We can redefine the value of a variable with the operator = (we don't
use the keyword var):

* myVar = 32;

You can redefine the value of the variable by using the variable
itself:

* var myVar = 55;
* myVar = myVar + 5;

There are some special shortcut operator for these kind of assigment:

* myVar += 5; instead of myVar = myVar + 5
* same with myVar -= 5;

If you try to access an empty variable the undifined value is
returned.

You can defined nultiple variable on one line:

* var myVar1 = 1, myVar2 = 2;
